-----------------------   @Named   ----------------------------------

Guice comes with a built-in binding annotation @Named that takes a string:

public class RealBillingService implements BillingService {

  @Inject
  public RealBillingService(@Named("Checkout") CreditCardProcessor processor,
      TransactionLog transactionLog) {
    ...
  }
To bind a specific name, use Names.named() to create an instance to pass to annotatedWith:

    bind(CreditCardProcessor.class)
        .annotatedWith(Names.named("Checkout"))
        .to(CheckoutCreditCardProcessor.class);
        
Since the compiler can't check the string, we recommend using @Named sparingly. Defining your own purpose-built annotations provides better type-safety.
